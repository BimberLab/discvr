## DISCVR

DISCVR is a web-based system designed to help individual labs manage and utilize the data they create. It is a series of modules that extend LabKey Server, a robust open-source platform designed to manage scientific data with a large and active user base. The objective of DISCVR is to provide additional features tailored specifically to research labs, beyond what is available through a standard LabKey Server.  This project is closely linked to [DISCVR-Seq](https://github.com/bbimber/discvr-seq/wiki), which is a sub-project aimed at next-generation sequencing.  DISCVR is open-source, with the code hosted in the main [LabKey Server subversion repository](https://www.labkey.org/wiki/home/Documentation/page.view?name=svn)

Please [see the wiki section for an overview](https://github.com/bbimber/discvr/wiki), instructions and more specific links to download these modules.
