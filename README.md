## DISCVR

DISCVR is a collection of extensions to LabKey Server, which is a robust open-source platform designed to manage scientific data with a large and active user base.  The objective of DISCVR is to provide additional features tailored specifically to research labs, beyond what is available through a standard LabKey Server.  DISCVR originally began as a system designed to help individual labs manage and utilize the data they create.  This is still a major focus; however, it has grown and now includes a heavy focus on next generation sequencing (see [DISCVR-Seq](https://github.com/bbimber/discvr-seq/wiki)), along with many other additional features.  DISCVR is open-source, with the code hosted in the main [LabKey Server subversion repository](https://www.labkey.org/wiki/home/Documentation/page.view?name=svn).  Please note: even though this GitHub project may not appear very active, new features are regularly added to the project's code in the subversion repository.
